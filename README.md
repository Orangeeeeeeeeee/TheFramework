# The Framework
*A modular foundation for my Minecraft plugins*

## 🔥 What is "The Framework"?
The Framework is the backbone of my plugin ecosystem, designed to handle core functionalities efficiently. It provides essential utilities, event management, and game logic that power all of my other custom plugins.

## ✨ Features
- 🏗 Centralized Core – Handles shared functionality across multiple plugins
- ⚡ Optimized Performance – Ensures efficiency and lightweight execution
- 🎮 Game Logic Management – Manages game rules, custom mechanics, and interactions
- 🛠 Modular Addon Support – Designed to be extended with additional plugins
- 🔊 Custom Sound & Message System – Standardized text formatting and sound handling

## 🔌 Plugins *(Addons)* That Use The Framework
- ✅ Economy – Handles all of the economy
- ✅ Spawn – Handles custom spawns over the game
- ✅ Items – Manages custom items
- ✅ Menus – Manages custom menus (compatible with *Items, Economy*)
- ✅ Drops – Handles all game drops (compatible with *Items*)
- ✅ More to come...

# 🎯 Why It Exists?
Instead of rewriting the same core functions for every plugin, The Framework acts as the foundation for all my projects. It simplifies development and ensures consistency, stability, and scalability across my plugins.

## 🚀 How It Works?
The Framework runs behind the scenes, ensuring that all my plugins work seamlessly together. It is not a standalone plugin but a core dependency for my Minecraft projects.
